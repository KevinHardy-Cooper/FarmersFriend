"You got a [farmer's] friend in me." - Toy Story

## Overview
A client-server web application built with a plethora of tools:
- Client side: HTML, CSS, and Javacript (with some AJAX)
- Server side: LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) Stack
- Hosted on Amazon Web Services through EC2 and S3
- Secured with SSL/TLS
- SHA-2 for user accounts
- Responsive and accessible web pages
- Data sanitization on client and server

Allows user to upload, review, and search for farms based on location, name or rating.  Pretty much Yelp but better because it's for farms.
